## About

A GitHub action to remove older releases with their tags based on a regex pattern. This action provides flexible filtering options to keep releases based on recency, age, or exclusion patterns.

**Key Features:**

- üéØ **Pattern-based filtering** - Use regex to target specific releases
- üìÖ **Age-based retention** - Keep releases newer than X days
- üî¢ **Count-based retention** - Keep the N most recent releases
- üö´ **Exclusion patterns** - Protect specific releases from deletion
- üîó **Tag cleanup** - Automatically removes associated Git tags
- ‚ö° **Parallel processing** - Fast deletion of multiple releases

## Usage

To use the action, add following to your workflow file

```yaml
- name: Delete Older Releases
  uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: "Build*"
    RELEASES_TO_KEEP: 5 # Optional: Keep the 5 most recent releases matching the pattern
```

## Inputs

Following inputs can be used as `step.with` keys

| Name                         | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`               | String  | ‚úÖ Yes   |         | [GitHub Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `contents:write` permissions to delete releases and tags |
| `RELEASE_PATTERN`            | String  | ‚úÖ Yes   |         | Regular expression pattern to match release tag names for deletion (e.g., `"^v1\\..*"` for all v1.x releases)    |
| `RELEASES_TO_KEEP`           | Number  | ‚ùå No    | `0`     | Number of most recent matching releases to keep (sorted by creation date). `0` means don't keep any by count     |
| `EXCLUDE_PATTERN`            | String  | ‚ùå No    | `""`    | Regular expression pattern to exclude releases from deletion (e.g., `".*-stable$"` to exclude stable releases)   |
| `DAYS_TO_KEEP`               | Number  | ‚ùå No    | `0`     | Number of days to keep releases. Releases newer than this will be preserved. `0` means don't keep any by age     |
| `DRY_RUN`                    | Boolean | ‚ùå No    | `false` | If `true`, the action will list the releases to be deleted without actually deleting them. Useful for testing.   |
| `DELETE_DRAFT_RELEASES_ONLY` | Boolean | ‚ùå No    | `false` | If `true`, only draft releases will be considered for deletion. This filter is applied before `RELEASE_PATTERN`. |
| `DELETE_PRERELEASES_ONLY`    | Boolean | ‚ùå No    | `false` | If `true`, only prereleases will be considered for deletion. This filter is applied before `RELEASE_PATTERN`.    |

### Input Validation

- `RELEASES_TO_KEEP` and `DAYS_TO_KEEP` must be non-negative integers
- `RELEASE_PATTERN` and `EXCLUDE_PATTERN` must be valid regular expressions
- Empty `RELEASE_PATTERN` will result in no releases being processed
- Invalid regex patterns will cause the action to fail with a descriptive error

## Input Interactions

### How the Action Works

The action follows this logic sequence:

1. **Draft Release Filtering**: If `DELETE_DRAFT_RELEASES_ONLY` is `true`, filter to include only draft releases.
2. **Prerelease Filtering**: If `DELETE_PRERELEASES_ONLY` is `true`, filter to include only prereleases.
3. **Pattern Matching**: Fetch all releases and filter by `RELEASE_PATTERN`
4. **Exclusion Filtering**: Remove releases matching `EXCLUDE_PATTERN` (if provided)
5. **Sort by Date**: Sort remaining releases by creation date (newest first)
6. **Preservation Logic**: For each release, keep it if **either** condition is true:
   - **Count-based**: Release is within the `RELEASES_TO_KEEP` most recent releases
   - **Age-based**: Release is newer than `DAYS_TO_KEEP` days old
7. **Deletion**: Delete releases and their associated tags that don't meet either preservation criteria

### Key Points

- **Draft-Only Filtering**: If `DELETE_DRAFT_RELEASES_ONLY` is `true`, the action will exclusively target draft releases, ignoring published releases. This filter is applied at the very beginning of the process.
- **Prerelease-Only Filtering**: If `DELETE_PRERELEASES_ONLY` is `true`, the action will exclusively target prereleases, ignoring stable releases. This filter is applied at the very beginning of the process.
- **OR Logic**: `RELEASES_TO_KEEP` and `DAYS_TO_KEEP` work with OR logic - a release is kept if it meets _either_ criteria
- **Exclusion Priority**: `EXCLUDE_PATTERN` is applied first, so excluded releases are never deleted regardless of other settings
- **Date Handling**: Invalid or missing creation dates are treated as very old (will be deleted unless kept by count)
- **Zero Values**: Setting `RELEASES_TO_KEEP=0` or `DAYS_TO_KEEP=0` disables that specific preservation method
- **Tag Cleanup**: When a release is deleted, its associated Git tag is also removed
- **Atomic Operations**: Each release and tag deletion is performed as a separate API call for reliability

## Examples

### Basic Usage - Delete All Matching Releases

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: "^beta-.*" # Delete all beta releases
```

### Delete Only Draft Releases

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: ".*" # Match all releases (drafts will be filtered by DELETE_DRAFT_RELEASES_ONLY)
    DELETE_DRAFT_RELEASES_ONLY: true # Only target draft releases for deletion
```

### Dry Run - See What Would Be Deleted

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: ".*" # Match all releases
    DRY_RUN: true # List releases to be deleted without actually deleting them
```

### Keep Recent Releases by Count

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: "^v[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+$" # Match semantic versions
    RELEASES_TO_KEEP: 3 # Keep the 3 most recent versions
```

### Keep Recent Releases by Age

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: ".*" # Match all releases
    DAYS_TO_KEEP: 30 # Keep releases from the last 30 days
```

### Combined Count and Age Preservation

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: "^v.*"
    RELEASES_TO_KEEP: 2 # Keep 2 most recent releases
    DAYS_TO_KEEP: 90 # AND/OR keep releases from last 90 days
    # A release is kept if it's either in the top 2 recent OR newer than 90 days
```

### Exclude Specific Releases

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: "^v.*"
    EXCLUDE_PATTERN: ".*-stable$" # Never delete releases ending with '-stable'
    RELEASES_TO_KEEP: 5
```

```yaml
- name: Delete Older Releases
  uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: "Build*"
    RELEASES_TO_KEEP: 5 # Optional: Keep the 5 most recent releases matching the pattern
```

### Delete Only Prereleases

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: ".*" # Match all releases (prereleases will be filtered by DELETE_PRERELEASES_ONLY)
    DELETE_PRERELEASES_ONLY: true # Only target prereleases for deletion
```

### Complex Cleanup Strategy

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    RELEASE_PATTERN: "^(dev|test|staging)-.*" # Target dev/test/staging releases
    EXCLUDE_PATTERN: ".*(important|milestone).*" # Protect important releases
    RELEASES_TO_KEEP: 10 # Keep 10 most recent matching releases
    DAYS_TO_KEEP: 7 # Also keep any from the last week
```

## Permissions

### Required GitHub Token Permissions

The GitHub token must have the following permissions:

- **`contents: write`** - Required to delete releases and tags
- **`metadata: read`** - Required to read repository information

### Token Setup Options

#### Option 1: Use GITHUB_TOKEN (Recommended)

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # ... other inputs
```

#### Option 2: Use Personal Access Token

If you need to run this action on a different repository or need additional permissions:

1. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
2. Add it as a repository secret (e.g., `GH_TOKEN`)
3. Use it in your workflow:

```yaml
- uses: nikhilbadyal/ghaction-rm-releases@v0.6.0
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    # ... other inputs
```

## Error Handling

The action provides detailed error messages for common issues:

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error Message                                     | Cause                                             | Solution                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Need Github Token`                               | Missing or empty `GITHUB_TOKEN`                   | Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided and not empty |
| `RELEASES_TO_KEEP must be a non-negative integer` | Invalid `RELEASES_TO_KEEP` value                  | Use a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, etc.)      |
| `DAYS_TO_KEEP must be a non-negative integer`     | Invalid `DAYS_TO_KEEP` value                      | Use a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, etc.)      |
| `Unable to list release`                          | API error or permissions issue                    | Check token permissions and repository access   |
| `Unable to delete release`                        | Insufficient permissions or release doesn't exist | Verify `contents:write` permission              |
| `Unable to delete tag`                            | Insufficient permissions or tag doesn't exist     | Verify `contents:write` permission              |
| Invalid regular expression                        | Malformed regex in patterns                       | Test regex patterns before using                |

### Dry Run / Testing

To test your configuration without actually deleting releases:

1. Fork your repository
2. Run the action on the fork first
3. Verify the behavior matches your expectations
4. Then apply to your main repository

## Troubleshooting

### No Releases Found

- Verify your `RELEASE_PATTERN` matches existing release tag names
- Check that releases exist in the repository
- Ensure the pattern is a valid regular expression

### Unexpected Deletions

- Review the [Input Interactions](#input-interactions) section
- Remember that `RELEASES_TO_KEEP` and `DAYS_TO_KEEP` use OR logic
- Check if `EXCLUDE_PATTERN` is working as expected

### Permission Errors

- Verify the token has `contents:write` permission
- For organization repositories, check if additional permissions are required
- Ensure the token hasn't expired

### Regex Pattern Help

- Test your regex patterns using online tools like [regex101.com](https://regex101.com)
- Remember to escape special characters in YAML strings
- Use double quotes for regex patterns in YAML

### Performance Considerations

- The action processes releases in parallel for better performance
- Large numbers of releases (100+) may take longer to process
- API rate limits may apply for repositories with many releases
